# ⚡ local-wpcli
A CLI to configure WP-CLI with the locally hosted websites of [Local by Flywheel](https://local.getflywheel.com/).

> This CLI does not support Local Lightning — latest major release — yet. Related issue for more information: [#13](https://github.com/asharirfan/local-wpcli/issues/13)

## 🚀 Getting Started!
Use the following command to install `local-wpcli` globally.

```node
npm install -g local-wpcli
```

## ✅ Usage
To use `local-wpcli`,

1. Open terminal and go to the root of the website folder.<br>	`cd ~/local-sites/local-wp/`
2. Type `local-wpcli` & press enter.
3. Before creating the configuration files, it will ask for:
	1. Remote Host (IP Address)
	2. Remote Port

👉 *Note: You can find `Remote Host` & `Port` in the `DATABASE` tab of the website in Local by Flywheel's desktop app. Please refer to the screenshot below for help.*
